# Why The Martingale Strategy Doesnt Work


Personal data project from Spring 2025 presented to UT's Business Analytics Association, demonstrating why the standard Martingale Strategy doesn't work for even bets, with adjustable parameters such as starting bet, betting limit, and more. 

Derived expected value equation using these variables and simulated sessions of the Martingale Strategy with cumulated profit (loss) over time.
